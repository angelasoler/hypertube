  Key Highlights:

  10 Implementation Phases spanning 12 weeks:
  1. Infrastructure & Foundation
  2. Core Microservices Architecture (5 services)
  3. Database Schema & Migrations
  4. Video Streaming Pipeline
  5. Security Implementation
  6. Frontend Implementation
  7. Testing Strategy
  8. Deployment & DevOps
  9. Performance Optimization
  10. Documentation & Handoff

  Critical Technical Details:
  - Microservices: User Management, Search/Library, Video Streaming, Comment Service, API
  Gateway
  - BitTorrent: Uses libtorrent4j (not prohibited libraries like
  webtorrent/pulsar/peerflix)
  - Streaming Pipeline: Sequential download → Buffer 5-10% → Start playback → Background
  conversion with FFmpeg
  - Security: Bcrypt password hashing, JWT authentication, input sanitization, SQL
  injection prevention, CSRF protection
  - Database Schema: Detailed tables for users, OAuth, videos, torrents, comments, watch
  history, download jobs
  - Frontend: Vue/Nuxt with infinite scroll, video player, subtitle selection, responsive
  design

  Six Critical Files identified to begin implementation:
  1. SecurityConfig.java - Authentication & security
  2. TorrentDownloadService.java - BitTorrent integration
  3. VideoConversionWorker.java - FFmpeg conversion pipeline
  4. API Gateway configuration - Service routing
  5. VideoPlayer.vue - Main player component
  6. docker-compose.yml - Service orchestration

  The plan provides a complete roadmap with specific code examples, security requirements,
   API endpoints, database schemas, and risk mitigation strategies.
